Current:
-lab partner page
	-User can leave review for a LabPartner
		-must require authentication in the appropriate route
-making the webpage look nice
	-Bootstrap-related ideas
		-display reviews with <blockquote>
		-style login/registration forms (with default style?)
		-use the text/bg color classes for messges to the user
		(e.g. account created, wrong password)
		-use breadcrumbs to show hierarchy of college to
		lab partner
		-put the website logo in the navigation bar
		-put the college search bar into the
		navigation bar
		-perhaps fix navigation bar to page's top
		-collapse the nav bar if it takes too much space
		-use glyphicons where possible


Eventually:
-----------

-there are some parts of code that I initially neglected
copying from the tutorial; examine these;
should end up checking off the entire tutorial
	

Considerable
------------

-figure out a clean way to prevent duplicates (e.g. usernames,
colleges) without having to use similar boilerplate code in
the respective Express routes
-figure out how to split angularApp.js into multiple files
-should I be serializing the user?
-although this is a trivial app, should I *not* hardcode
the secret used for signing the tokens
	-is hardcoded in:
		-routes/index.js
		-mdoels/Users.js
	-could use environment variable instead
-if the user logs in while in the college page, he should
be redirected to that same page, rather than to the home
page again


Junk users and passwords (for manual testing)
