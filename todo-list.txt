Current:
-the college page
	-lab partner database stuff
		-fix the GET route
		-probably have to populate the College in its GET route
		-use "auth" in the POST route (perhaps the issue
		is in the case-sensitivity)
			-use the "headers" bearer thing, you dummy
	-only show lab partners for a given college (in search bar)
		-filter for partners in the lab partner promise by college
	-should lab partners be ordered by name on the html form?
	-if the user logs in while in the college page, he should
	be redirected to that same page, rather than to the home
	page again
-lab partner page
	-Review model instance
		-subject/class
		-rating
		-comments
	-User can leave review for a LabPartner
		-must require authentication in the appropriate route
-making the webpage look nice
	-Bootstrap-related ideas
		-display reviews with <blockquote>
		-style login/registration forms (with default style?)
		-use the text/bg color classes for messges to the user
		(e.g. account created, wrong password)
		-use breadcrumbs to show hierarchy of college to
		lab partner
		-put the website logo in the navigation bar
		-put the college search bar into the
		navigation bar
		-perhaps fix navigation bar to page's top
		-collapse the nav bar if it takes too much space
		-use glyphicons where possible


Eventually:
-----------

-there are some parts of code that I initially neglected
copying from the tutorial; examine these;
should end up checking off the entire tutorial
	

Considerable
------------

-figure out a clean way to prevent duplicates (e.g. usernames,
colleges) without having to use similar boilerplate code in
the respective Express routes
-figure out how to split angularApp.js into multiple files
-should I be serializing the user?
-although this is a trivial app, should I *not* hardcode
the secret used for signing the tokens
	-is hardcoded in:
		-routes/index.js
		-mdoels/Users.js
	-could use environment variable instead


Junk users and passwords (for manual testing)
