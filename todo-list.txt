Current:
-logging in and registering
	-there are some parts of code that I initially neglected
	copying (e.g. the onEnter member of the login state
	in angularApp.js) from the tutorial; examine these;
	should end up checking off the entire tutorial
	-program crashes if try to register already existing user
		-in register handler, try to find the username;
		if it's found, report the error
	-probably add navigation bar; move log in/register/log out
	links to that bar

Upcoming Tasks (not yet in any particular order)
(NOTE: it's okay if the webpage looks terrible at first):
-LabPartner model instance
-User/Reviewer model instance
-User can leave review for a LabPartner
	-must require authentication in the appropriate route
-Review model instance
	-subject/class
	-rating
	-comments

Eventually:
-make the webpage look nice with CSS, Bootstrap, etc.
-since this is a trivial app, should I *not* hardcode
the secret used for signing the tokens
	-is hardcoded in:
		-routes/index.js
		-mdoels/Users.js
	-could use environment variable instead
