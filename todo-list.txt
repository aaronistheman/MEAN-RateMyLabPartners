-figure out a clean way to prevent duplicates (e.g. usernames,
colleges) without having to use similar boilerplate code in
the respective Express routes
-figure out how to split angularApp.js into multiple files
-should I be serializing the user?
-although this is a trivial app, should I *not* hardcode
the secret used for signing the tokens
	-is hardcoded in:
		-routes/index.js
		-mdoels/Users.js
	-could use environment variable instead
-if the user logs in while in the college page, he should
be redirected to that same page, rather than to the home
page again
-make entire webpage responsive


Junk users and passwords (for manual testing)
