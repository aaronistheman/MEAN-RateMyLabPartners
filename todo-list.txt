Current:
-logging in and registering
	-to test, have some text that says any of the following two
	statements: 1) "You're logged in", 2) "You're not logged in"
		-skim through tutorial
			-maybe build *basic* AngularJS front-end
		-use AngularJS factory to adjust the text
	-don't hardcode iterations or key length

Upcoming Tasks (not yet in any particular order)
(NOTE: it's okay if the webpage looks terrible at first):
-LabPartner model instance
-User/Reviewer model instance
-User can leave review for a LabPartner
	-must require authentication in the appropriate route
-Review model instance
	-subject/class
	-rating
	-comments

Eventually:
-make the webpage look nice with CSS, Bootstrap, etc.
-since this is a trivial app, should I *not* hardcode
the secret used for signing the tokens
	-is hardcoded in:
		-routes/index.js
		-mdoels/Users.js
	-could use environment variable instead
