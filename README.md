# MEAN-RateMyLabPartners

(Last updated: 3/30/2017)

About
-----

This is a comical, trivial version of RateMyProfessors.com
meant for rating lab partners instead :-)

There's not much to this project, as it was just meant to help me try
out the MEAN framework.

Languages/Software Used: JavaScript, MEAN framework
(MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, AngularJS, Node.js), HTML/CSS,
Bootstrap.

Features
--------

* Can create a basic account to leave a review.

* Can view a college's list of reviewed lab partners.

* Can view the reviews and average rating of a lab partner.

* Can introduce a new (not yet reviewed) lab partner.

* Admin account can introduce a new college.

* Use of breadcrumbs to present a navigational hierarchy to the user.

* Reasonably good-looking UI (though this wasn't my main priority
with this application).

To Run
------

In a terminal, at the top level of the project, enter:

```
npm start
```

Then open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) and navigate to the
following url: http://localhost:3000

used in this application (e.g. the password-setting code for the UserSchema):
